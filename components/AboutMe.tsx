        Hi, my name&#39;s Sam, I work at Jaguar Land Rover as an Electrical Degree Apprentice. Day-to-day I develop in-house solutions for enabling real-time Level 5 In-the-Loop testing.
        <br /><br />
        In my extra time I develop fullstack web applications using React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and MySQL. I also believe in using built-in typesafety within applications to ensure the upmost security and maintainability.
        <br /><br />
        I&#39;m competively spirited, striving for perfection in every aspect. I have a passion for engineering and problem solving.
